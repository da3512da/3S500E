I bought XC3S500E XILINX Spartan-3E FPGA Development Board of ebay. The purchase came with a DVD containing code and layout information for the board.  I left the DVD at work and took the board home.  At home I couldn't find out what FGPA pins were connected to which header, which is contained in the ucf.  I searched online and was unable to find the information any where.

So this is the required contents of the disk.  I have uploaded the ucf file and all the vhdl and verilog code.  It is not great code, and I haven't edited any of it, but it does seem to work.  

I also uploaded the **minimum** required to get each design synthesised.  I have left it with the DVD xise file, which is for some old rev of ISE, 12.2 I believe.  My version of ISE, 14.7, had no problem migrating the designs.
